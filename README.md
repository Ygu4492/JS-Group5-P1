Create a client-side JavaScript task manager with the following features and functionality.

- 3 Marks - Users should be able to add, edit, and delete tasks.

- 3 Marks - Record at least 5 different details about each task. For example, you will at least need the Task description and who it is assigned to. Choose 3 or more other details to include for each task.

- 3 Marks - Store the tasks in localStorage. When the page loads, it should check localStorage and display all the tasks.

- 3 Marks - There should be a search filter that allows you to only display tasks that contain a certain text. If any detail of a task contains the text, it should be displayed. For example, if a person's name is typed in the search filter, only notes that contain their name or that are assigned to them should be displayed. Use Array.prototype.filter() to filter list of tasks.

- 1 Mark - Use CSS to make it look appealing. Display tasks in different colors. This can be random, alternating, or depend on the details of the task.

- 1 Mark â€“ One mark for code readability. Make your code readable by making proper and consistent use of whitespace and indenting.

- 1 Mark - One mark for code maintainability. Make good use of control structures, and standard and custom functions to reduce duplicate code.

Have one member of the group submit the project in eConestoga.
